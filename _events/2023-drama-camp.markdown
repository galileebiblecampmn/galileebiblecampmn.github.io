    <h4>NEW this year: Drama Camp</h4>
    <p>
      Youth grades 7-12 interested in acting or helping produce a dramatic play are invited to this
      summer’s Drama Camp! Come camp with us and be led by experienced drama leaders as we prepare
      to perform “A Tale of Two Compromises,” a two-act play written by Michael Rokenbrodt. By day,
      campers will be immersed into the world of ancient Israel and revolutionary France as our
      campers will act out this Old Testament story set in the French “Reign of Terror.” By night,
      campers will enjoy worship and fellowship with their fellow theater lovers. Come, camp, have
      fun, and engage in the world of the Bible in a new and powerful way!

Michael minored in Theatre Arts at Concordia University-Saint Paul, where he wrote and directed while also performing on a traveling drama ministry team, The Good News Players. Later, he started his own drama ministry team Messiah Minutemen while coaching high school drama and speech in Minnesota and Illinois. He also developed a fifteen year performing arts program at Lutheran Island Camp (Henning, MN) and partnered with a friend to start a nonprofit WatchWord (watchwordministries.com) which has featured Christian role play mysteries and retreats across the country. Lately, he has been writing and directing productions for the Free Lutheran Bible College (Plymouth, MN) and assisting their Gospel Puppet and Drama team. His summers are now devoted to bringing drama ministry into congregations across the country. This summer will include productions in Oregon, Pennsylvania, Maryland, Minnesota, and Wisconsin. His seasonal mission work in Uganda works with Ambassador Institute which incorporates drama into the process of teaching and memorizing scripture.

##### Amy Dalager

Amy Dalager has long performance experience in her early life as an actress, violinist, and pianist, but these days her real passion is teaching and directing. After a hiatus from theater to go to college and raise a family, Amy began directing at Stephen-Argyle Central High School in 2011, where she currently teaches music as well as directing the musical and One Act Play every year. Past musicals she has directed include "Beauty and the Beast," "Seussical the Musical," "Mary Poppins," "Into the Woods," "Once on This Island," "Shrek the Musical," "You're a Good Man, Charlie Brown," "She Loves Me," and "The Wizard of Oz." Her current directing job encompasses all aspects of theater production: on stage, backstage, and up in the tech booth.

In addition to her teaching and directing work at SAC High School, Amy runs a month-long drama club each spring for SAC elementary school students. She has also worked five summers at Trollwood Performing Arts School (Moorhead, MN) as a music teacher and acting coach for their ArtSpark program, a theater camp for elementary-age actors.

A Christian since her baptism, Amy is excited to bring her love of theater and storytelling into the realm of Christian ministry. She has a heart for the clear preaching of the Word, and is looking forward to bringing the message of God's saving grace to the actors, crew members, and audiences at camp this summer.
